“Charlie Chaplin has gotten into software development, coding, and the like... He made a company, but it recently came under fire for a PR disaster. He got **all over the internet** before he realized the company's mistake, and is now scrambling to clean up his mess, but it may be too late!! Find his Twitter Account and investigate! *NOTE THAT THESE CHALLENGES DO NOT HAVE DO BE DONE IN ORDER!”*

search “Chaplin Chaplin Coding” on twitter and you will get one result

https://twitter.com/ChaplinCoding

Now go to the “view lists” under the three dots next to follow (You need an account to see it)

You’ll find the flag in the second list

“Wow Charlie even set up a linkedin account, but not well it is kind of a mess. Is the PR nightmare here??
The inner content of this flag begins with **"pr"**“
This time you should go to linkedin to search up their name.

I searched up “C3D” as specified from their website to get their profile

https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13984825/

Go to their owners page and under his profile he’ll mention “I ran a event called "**Top Hat Development Night**". It was very cool, you can find it on linkedin still search it up”

Search up "**Top Hat Development Night**" under events and you’ll get the event and flag under it

https://www.linkedin.com/events/6822753659445743616/

you’ll figure out the profile under https://github.com/charliechaplindev

Straightup doxx Charlie by finding the email he set all these accounts up with, and investigate it.
The inner content of this flag begins with **"b0"**


So now to find Charlie Chaplin dev 's e-mail address I used github. 

https://github.com/charliechaplindev/C3D-Official/commit/ce81ede5ab18b6f4ca32ace4359c5570954dfc9b.patch

Remove the dot patch extension for regular layout. 

Then I used the good old article https://medium.com/week-in-osint/getting-a-grasp-on-googleids-77a8ab707e43

And found contributions on Google maps at this location :
